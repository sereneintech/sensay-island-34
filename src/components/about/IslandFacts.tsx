              Human history offers unparalleled wisdom yet repeats the same mistakes. By encoding the insights 
              of exemplary leaders ‚Äî Marcus Aurelius, Eleanor Roosevelt, Nelson Mandela and more ‚Äî into transparent, 
              ethics-bound AI systems, we aim to transcend short-term politics and govern for long-term flourishing.

              Sensay Island is where policy is data-driven, rights-anchored, and continuously audited for fairness. 
              Residents remain free, informed, and empowered to override or amend AI decisions through democratic 
              safeguards embedded in our Charter.
